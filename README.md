# Where Should You Retire? Spain vs. Belize

## A Comparison of Amenities and Infrastructure of an Iberian Destination and a Caribbean Paradise.

If you've ever found yourself wondering what it would be like to retire in Madrid, Spain or Belize but wanted a side-by-side comparison of features you care about, this is the right place.

Best of all, I use geospatial data to help visualize the density of these features in a beautifully laid out map.

In this notebook, I answer some of the following questions:

-   Which country has better public transformation?
-   Which country might have more enjoyable amenities?
-   Which country seems more family-friendly?
-   Which country is more eco-friendly?
    etc.
